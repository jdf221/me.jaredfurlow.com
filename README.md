Just my personal site nothing special.

Uses [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) as a build tool, but there really isn't any crazy JS or framework behind the site. But a build tool just makes life easier.

Uses [WindiCSS](https://windicss.org/) (Same as [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)) for utility-first based styling. Honestly just really enjoy the Tailwind style of doing CSS.

The site is composed of Handlebar template files located in [`src/partials`](src/partials) and a little JS in [`src/main.js`](src/main.js).

The built version is on the [`gh-pages` branch](https://github.com/jdf221/me.jaredfurlow.com/tree/gh-pages)
